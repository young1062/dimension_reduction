<h2> Supplementary Numerical Examples </h2>
All numerical examples were created in RMarkdown.  References to packages and data are presented wherever possible and links to the corresponding R Markdown files used to generate the examples are contained in the repository.

All examples were created with the intent of helping students develop intuition for the geometric details and goals of the specific algorithms and to introduce relevant packages and syntax used to call these methods in R.  Importantly, students were provided access to each of the Markdown files used to generate the documents so that they could reproduce the examples and use the existing code on problem sets.
