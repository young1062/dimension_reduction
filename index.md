<h2> Welcome </h2>
This webpage contains content for an introductory course in Dimension Reduction offered by Harvard University's <a href="https://statistics.fas.harvard.edu/">Statistics Department</a> which was originally developed for the Fall 2019 semester.   It covers classical topics such as principal component analysis, nonnegative matrix factorization, and clustering with theory and illustrative applications.  

This site contains a complete list of the covered topics and corresponding <a href="web_content/notes"> lecture notes</a> and in some cases <a href="web_content/numerics"> numerical examples</a>.  All files can be found and cloned from the corresponding github repository for educational use.

<h2> Course Philosophy </h2>

Dimension reduction is a vast field comprised of many goals, assumptions, and algorithms.  Often, the background material relevant to a specific algorithm relies on more advanced (graduate) level analysis.  However, this class is targeted at upper level undergraduate students and assumes familiarity with multivariate statistics and undergraduate linear algebra. The goal of this course is not to provide a complete summary of existing methods or software packages.  Rather, using mostly linear algebra, probability, and some coding in R,  selected techniques are explored and their strengths/weaknesses are discussed.  This course focuses largely on a geometrical perspective of dimension reduction algorithms and the curious and often surprising nature of high-dimensional data.  In addition to 7 homework assignments and a midterm, students are tasked with writing a term paper exploring the details of a dimension reduction technique not covered in the class. 

<h2> Acknowledgements and References </h2>

The original development and perspective was driven largely by an extremely helpful conversation with <a href="https://www.paulbendich.com/">Paul Bendich </a> of Duke University's Mathematics Department.  His insight on his dimension reduction course helped establish the general approach to this class.  Secondly, the texts 
<ul>
<li> <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/"> The Elements of Statistical Learning </a> by Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibrishani, and Jerome Friedman </li>
<li> <a href="https://astro.temple.edu/~alan/MMST/"> Modern Multivariate Statistical Techniques </a> by Alan Julian Izenmann </li>
</ul>
were instrumental to the construction of the lecture notes and select exercises from those texts are used in some of the recommended problem sets.
