<h1> Welcome </h1>
This webpage contains content for an introductory course in Dimension Reduction first taught at Harvard University during the Fall 2019 semester.   
It covers classical topics such as principal component analysis, nonnegative matrix factorization, and clustering with illustrative applications. The goals of this course is not to provide a complete summary of existing methods or software packages.  Rather, using mostly linear algebra, probability, and some coding in R, we  selected techniques are explored and their strengths/weaknesses are discussed.  This course focuses largely on a geometrical perspective of dimension reduction algorithms and the curious and often surprising nature of high-dimensional data.  

This site contains a complete list of the covered topics and corresponding <a href=/notes/> lecture notes</a> and in some cases <a href=/numerics> numerical examples </a>.
